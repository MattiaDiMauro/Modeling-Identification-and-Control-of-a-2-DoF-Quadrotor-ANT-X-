# Modeling-Identification-and-Control-of-a-2-DoF-Quadrotor-ANT-X-
Developed a robust digital control system and performed dynamic model identification for the ANT-X 2DoF quadrotor. Implemented calibrated 1DoF attitude models, advanced time-domain ID, and discrete PID/cascade controllers. Validated via real-time HIL tests using MATLAB, ROS, PX4 and QGroundControl.
